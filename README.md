# SilentETHMiner v1.0.1 - Based on Lime Miner v0.3


## Main Features

* .NET - Coded in Visual Basic .NET, requires .NET Framework 4.5
 
* Codedom - No need for external libraries to compile

* Injection (Silent) - Hide payload behind another process

* Idle Mining - Can be configured to only mine when the computer isn't in use
  
* Stealth - Pauses the miner while Task Manager, Process Explorer or Process Hacker is open

* Watchdog - Replaces the miner if removed and starts it if closed down

* Ethash - Supports mining all Ethash coins like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Metaverse, Ellaism, QuarkChain and others

## Requirements

When mining with the Ethash algorithm you need to have enough GPU memory left to store the DAG. So for example, mining Ethereum requires you to have at least a minimum GPU memory of 4.14 GB available since that is the size of the DAG as of writing this. Due to this, GPUs that have less available memory than the required DAG are not able to mine at all.
The other thing required is a recent enough CUDA or OpenCL compatible driver for your GPU.

So the requirements are as follow:
1. Enough GPU memory for the DAG
2. Supported drivers
